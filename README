Raspberry Pi 3

Intro
=====

Minimal Raspberry Pi 3 image based on the standard
board package for Raspberry Pi. Drivers for the 
built in WIFI and Bluetooth chips has been added
as packages and are enabled by default. A slimmed
defconfig file for the kernel is located in:

   board/rpi3/kernel/rpi3_minimal_defconfig



How to build it
===============

Configure Buildroot
-------------------

A defconfig file for Raspberry Pi 3 has been created which
you should base your work on. Load it by executing:

   $ make rpi3_minimal_defconfig


Build the rootfs
----------------

Note: you will need to have access to the network, since Buildroot will
download the packages' sources.

You may now build your rootfs with:

  $ make

(This may take a while, consider getting yourself a coffee ;-) )

Result of the build
-------------------

After building, you should obtain this tree:

    output/images/
    +-- bcm2710-rpi-3-b.dtb
    +-- boot.vfat
    +-- kernel-marked/zImage        [1]
    +-- rootfs.ext4
    +-- rpi-firmware/
    |   +-- bootcode.bin
    |   +-- cmdline.txt
    |   +-- config.txt
    |   +-- fixup.dat
    |   `-- start.elf
    +-- sdcard.img
    `-- zImage

[1] This is the mkknlimg DT-marked kernel.

How to write the SD card
========================

Once the build process is finished you will have an image called "sdcard.img"
in the output/images/ directory.

Copy the bootable "sdcard.img" onto an SD card with "dd":

  $ sudo dd if=output/images/sdcard.img of=/dev/sdX

Insert the SDcard into your Raspberry Pi, and power it up.








Buildroot is a simple, efficient and easy-to-use tool to generate embedded
Linux systems through cross-compilation.

The documentation can be found in docs/manual. You can generate a text
document with 'make manual-text' and read output/docs/manual/manual.text.
Online documentation can be found at http://buildroot.org/docs.html

To build and use the buildroot stuff, do the following:

1) run 'make menuconfig'
2) select the target architecture and the packages you wish to compile
3) run 'make'
4) wait while it compiles
5) find the kernel, bootloader, root filesystem, etc. in output/images

You do not need to be root to build or run buildroot.  Have fun!

Buildroot comes with a basic configuration for a number of boards. Run
'make list-defconfigs' to view the list of provided configurations.

Please feed suggestions, bug reports, insults, and bribes back to the
buildroot mailing list: buildroot@buildroot.org
You can also find us on #buildroot on Freenode IRC.
